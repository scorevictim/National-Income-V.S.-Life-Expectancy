# Abstract

The rise in human life expectancy at birth over the past two centuries is a remarkable accomplishment of modern civilization. At present, among the worldâ€™s nations, Japanese women have the highest life expectancy at birth, above 87 years. International objectives for increasing life expectancy and overall health have generally been focused on increasing the quality of healthcare accessible to individuals. These initiatives for increasing the quality of healthcare almost always pertain to reducing healthcare expenses, making it easier and more affordable for individuals to receive the healthcare that they need. Evidence suggests that social and economic factors such as income and level of education may have a larger effect on increasing general well-being and life expectancy than previously thought.

This project is a cross-country analysis of the factors affecting the life expectancy at birth and discusses the causal relationship of each of these factors to answer the established hypothesis. We have estimated and interpreted the multivariate linear regression models using actual data and employed appropriate statistical tests taught to us in this course to complete this project.
